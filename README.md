# Information-Retrivail
We use the corpus on the social networks as the retrieved set of documents for the query. In this project, we use a number of techniques that generate the relevant post document for the events by composing the core plot of story as it evolves over time on the social network. We provide an algorithm that uses relevant data to produce time line of certain event and arrange the key related post in the logic order. To be specifc, the recommended post of news consists of the initial report, the development of events and the outcome of this event. The recommended posts is updated at its own frequency which depends on the trending activity in social data. Therefore, this system will provide the evolution of a event when social network user post new relevant articles continuously, forming a new approach to discovering and archiving information on a topic.The overview of our project includes: processing the original corpus on the Twitter, re-ranking them with a number of proposed techniques, and provide the recommendation post based on the story line. Our project will include these sections: (1) we introduce the query expansion so that our system can aggregated social information from the social network; (2) we utilize a time line generation algorithm; (3) we show the recommended post in the logic order.
